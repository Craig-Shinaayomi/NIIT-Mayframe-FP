## 🧠 Project Overview

**NIIT Mayframe FP** is a modern **front-end web application** designed and deployed as part of a NIIT training/assignment project. The app is hosted on **Vercel**, indicating it’s built using a JavaScript framework (likely **React**, **Next.js**, or a visual-build tool like **Framer**) and optimized for a dynamic client-side experience.

The app currently requires JavaScript enabled in the browser to function, which suggests interactive components and dynamic rendering.

## 🛠️ Purpose & Motivation

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world front-end development skills, including:

✔ Building responsive user interfaces
✔ Utilizing modern JavaScript frameworks
✔ Deploying web apps to a cloud platform (Vercel)
✔ Following best practices in UI/UX and code structure
✔ Applying concepts learned in NIIT web development training

This project is ideal for **portfolio showcase**, skill validation, and assessment as part of NIIT coursework.
